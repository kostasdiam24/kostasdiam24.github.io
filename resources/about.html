          Hi, I'm Konstantinos Diamantopoulos, a 15-year-old web developer from
          Greece. I got into web development because I had a lot of free time
          and loved creating things. Plus, I found out that it's pretty easy and
          quick to learn. What really pulled me in was the idea of working
          remotely and earning enough to live comfortably.
        </p>
        <div class="skill-card">
          <i class="fa-brands fa-html5 fa-8x" style="color: #f06529"></i>
        </div>

        <p>
          I’ve learned HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript through Codecademy, which
          has been awesome. I have a few certificates that show what I’ve
          learned so far. I'm still new to this, so I don’t specialize in any
          particular projects yet, but I'm always excited to learn more and take
          on new challenges.
        </p>

        <div class="skill-card">
          <i class="fa-brands fa-css3-alt fa-8x" style="color: #2965f1"></i>
        </div>

        <p>
          I don’t have any professional experience just yet, but I’ve been
          working on my own projects at home. I’ve made clones of Spotify and
          YouTube, along with a few other cool projects. These have been great
          practice and helped me get better at coding.
        </p>

        <div class="skill-card">
          <i class="fa-brands fa-js fa-8x" style="color: #f0db4f"></i>
        </div>

        <p>
          For me, web development is a way to live a financially free life and
          travel the world. I also love helping people create their own
          websites, especially since not everyone knows how to code. One of my
          big goals was to learn JavaScript by the end of the year, and I’m
          happy to say I’ve done that, even though I’m still learning more
          advanced stuff. The best part about being a web developer is that I
          can work whenever and wherever I want.
        </p>
